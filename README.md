# VQE and Grover mixer -QAOA approach to topological data analysis algorithm - the supersymmetry lattice model with N=2

## 1. Introduction 
We investigate QAOA and VQE performance for a relatively new class of constrained optimization problems in this open hackathon challenge. In concrete, we consider the supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanic lattice N=2 model introduced by Fendley, Schoutens, and Boer [[0.1103/PhysRevLett.90.120402](http://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.120402)]. This model is exciting since determining the supersymmetric ground states of a Hamiltonian with the fermion number $l$ is equivalent to finding $l$-dimensional holes in the corresponding independence complex. This finding is vital in topological data analysis (TDA) - an approach for analyzing data using tools from topology.
